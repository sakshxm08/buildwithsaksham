Drive is a lightweight, self-hosted file management application designed for simplicity and real-world utility. It offers a clean interface to organize and interact with files in isolated user directories — no unnecessary complexity, just the features you actually need.

- Edit files directly in the browser  
- User-based access control with multiple users supported  
- Each user mapped to their own isolated directory for privacy and separation  
- Basic authentication system (demo credentials included for quick testing)

**Use Cases**  
- Standalone self-hosted file manager for personal or small-team use  
- Quick file access, sharing, and editing in a controlled environment  
- Integrated app within the buildwithsaksham monorepo ecosystem

**Philosophy**  
Built to be practical, minimal, and extensible — focused on solving everyday file management needs without heavy abstractions or bloat.
