### npx buildwithsaksham – Personal Info CLI

🚀 **Current Version**  
v1.0.9

🧩 **About**  
`npx buildwithsaksham` is a lightweight, zero-setup command-line tool that instantly displays a clean, personalized information card for Saksham Gambhir right in your terminal.  

It’s a fun, modern way to share profile details, links, and quick actions without ever leaving the command line — perfect for networking, quick intros, or just showing off in a dev terminal.

✨ **Features**  
- Beautiful, well-formatted info card rendered in the terminal  
- Interactive experience with guided options  
- Direct links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles  
- One-click option to compose and send an email  
- Runs instantly via `npx` — no installation required  

▶️ **Usage**  
Just run this in any terminal:

```bash
npx buildwithsaksham@latest
```

The tool launches immediately, shows the card, and lets you interact (e.g., open links, send email). Use @latest to always get the newest version.

📌 **Notes**
- Great as a personal branding / digital business card in CLI form
- Fully standalone but lives as a utility app in the buildwithsaksham monorepo
- Fits the ecosystem: quick, practical, minimal overhead
- Repo path: apps/npx (or wherever the CLI source lives in the monorepo)

Built for developers who love terminals and want to share who they are in one command.
