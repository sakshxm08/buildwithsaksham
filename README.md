# 🛠️ buildwithsaksham

A growing ecosystem of tools and apps I build to improve how I work, track, and create.

This is my personal monorepo — home to independent CLI tools, web apps, utilities, and experiments I use daily. Everything here is built for real personal needs, iterated over time, and occasionally polished enough to share.

## 🚀 What's Inside

### 📦 Apps
Standalone applications, each with its own purpose and entry point.

| App           | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **npx**       | Quick CLI command (via npx) that displays my contact info, links, and shortcuts. |
| **drive**     | Personal file organizer with custom metadata tagging and search.        |
| **portfolio** | My public-facing portfolio site showcasing projects, writings, and links. |
| **subgrid**   | Subscription & billing tracker dashboard — overview of recurring costs and services. |
| *(more coming)* | Future tools will land here as modular, focused apps.                 |

## 🛠️ Tech & Structure

Monorepo layout:
- `apps/` — individual applications (each runnable/deployable on its own)
- `.github/` — CI/CD workflows and automation

Languages in use : Go, Vue, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

Built with love for productivity, minimalism, and scratching my own itches.
